## Simplewap 

Back in 2014, when I first learned programming, it wasn't easy.
I don't have a laptop or computer to study, I'm only armed with symbian phones.
With that cellphone and a few lines of code from the Simplewap application I learned how to code.
Nostalgia, I rewrote all the code with the laravel framework.
